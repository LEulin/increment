<p>A Logbook System works as a daily record for business transactions. It is applicable to all businesses most especially with logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hotels, schools, and many more. One of the things that most businesses aim, is the elimination of a manual system. Technically, there is no harm in applying a manual logbook system, since start-up companies always begin with that. Nowadays, a lot of industries are slowly shifting to software innovation; aiming for minimal resource consumption, such as hiring people to man for logbook monitoring, and thinking, why not handle it in one seating, with just having a centralized software where you can manage all the monitoring at once.</p>
