        The Employee Management System maintains the professional and personal
        details of the employees as well as the company itself, in an organized
        manner. Itâ€™s importance to the company is that it manages and lowers the
        burden or even pressure on the Human Resource Department and Business
        Managers. This does not just benefit the established companies, but also
        those who are managing their business alone, with a starting number of
        workforce; since start-up business needs to be taken care and monitored
        in order for it to expand.
